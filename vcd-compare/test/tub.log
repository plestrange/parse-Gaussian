 THE SCIENTIFIC THEORIST IS NOT TO BE ENVIED. FOR NATURE, OR MORE
 PRECISELY EXPERIMENT, IS AN INEXORABLE AND NOT VERY FRIENDLY JUDGE OF HIS
 WORK.  IT NEVER SAYS "YES" TO A THEORY. IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CASES
 IT SAYS "MAYBE", AND IN THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CASES SIMPLY "NO"...
 PROBABLY EVERY THEORY WILL SOME DAY EXPERIENCE ITS "NO" - MOST
 THEORIES, SOON AFTER CONCEPTION.  -- A.EINSTEIN, NOV 11, 1922.
